    Syntax ->
        {() => {
            console.log("called");
        }, [counter1]};
4. Multiple Dependencies => It will execute in update the multiple counter and then after first render method.

        {() => {
            console.log("called");
        }, [counter1][counter2]};

    Syntax -> 
        {() => {
            console.log("called");
        }, [counter1][counter2]};
useLayoutEffect =>
